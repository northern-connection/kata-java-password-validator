# Kata Password Validator in Java

Forked from:
[Luis Rovirosa - Katas en Java](https://github.com/luisrovirosa/katas-java)

## Goal
We want to ensure that our users' passwords have the following rules:

	 - Have more than 8 characters
	 - Contains a capital letter
	 - Contains a lowercase
	 - Contains a number
	 - Contains an underscore

## Key
This kata shows the importance of:

	- selecting the test order
	- having good assertions (testing only one thing and being always true)
